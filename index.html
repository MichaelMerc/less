                <h5 class="margin">- The phrase <span class="bold-txt">less is more</span> means that having just the essential things is better than having way too much of superfluous things. It allows you to focus on what matters.</h5>

                <h4 class="margin">Origin of Less is More</h4>
                <h5 class="margin">This expression first appeared in a poem by Robert Browning, Andrea del Sarto, in the year 1855.</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Yet do much less, so much less…Well, less is more, Lucrezia; I am judged.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5 class="margin">Many designers use this expression as a philosophy or inspiration to design things that are simple, yet beautiful.</h5>
                <h5 class="margin">The idea behind this expression is that it is possible to overdo something. For example, imagine having a lot of dialogue in an action movie. Many people would be disappointed because they expected fight scenes but, instead, found lots of sitting around and talking. This idea can apply to many different things. One popular example is the idea that having fewer personal items leads to greater happiness.</h5>
